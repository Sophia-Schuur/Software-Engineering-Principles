"Heroku Files" and everything in it is the actual folder deployed to Heroku now. 
"SmileAPI" and its contents included for grading purposes, but are not neccessary for Heroku deployment.

Instructions given in skeleton code readme to deploy app to Heroku resulted in a 404 error. 
Figured out how to deploy properly after some googling and fiddling around. Results are in "Heroku Files".
